Transaction Tracker
This is a simple web application that allows you to track your transactions. You can see a table of all transactions, add new transactions, and filter transactions by description.

Usage
Table of Transactions
The table of transactions displays all of the transactions that have been added. It includes the following columns:

Date: The date that the transaction occurred.
Description: A description of the transaction.
Amount: The amount of the transaction.
Add New Transaction
To add a new transaction, you can fill out the form at the top of the page. The form includes the following fields:

Date: The date that the transaction occurred.
Description: A description of the transaction.
Amount: The amount of the transaction.
After filling out the form, you can submit it by clicking the "Add Transaction" button. This will add the new transaction to the table.

Note that the new transaction is not persisted to the backend. It is only added to the table in the browser.

Filter Transactions
To filter transactions by description, you can type into the search bar at the top of the page. Only transactions with a description matching the search term will be shown in the table. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial words.
